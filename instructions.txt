Instructions to Run Binary Classification Demo
===========================================

1. Setup Python Environment
-------------------------
- Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system (this tested with 3.14)

2. Install Required Packages
--------------------------
Run this command to install all required packages:
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn imbalanced-learn

3. Prepare Data
--------------
Make sure the file 'us_catering_orders.csv' is in the same directory as binary_classification_demo.py

4. Run the Demo
--------------
Run this command:
python binary_classification_demo.py

5. Expected Output
----------------
The demo will:
- Load the catering orders dataset
- Show dataset information and class distribution
- Train a decision tree model
- Display evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix)
- Show predictions for sample use cases
- Generate a confusion matrix

Note: If you see any plots, close them to allow the program to continue executing all steps.

Troubleshooting
--------------
If you encounter any errors:
1. Verify all required packages are installed
2. Ensure us_catering_orders.csv is in the correct location
3. Check that you have write permissions in the directory (for plot generation)
